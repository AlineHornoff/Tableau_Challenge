# Tableau_Challenge - City bike System New York

First proposed in 2008 by the New York City Department of Transportation, Citi Bike's scheduled 2011 opening was delayed by Hurricane Sandy and technological problems. It officially opened in May 2013 with 332 stations and 6,000 bikes. By October 2017 annual expansions brought the totals to 706 stations and 12,000 bikes, making the service the largest bike sharing program in the United States. Further expansions for Citi Bike are planned to extend its service area across the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, and increase the number of bikes to 40,000.

In October 2017 the system reached a total of 50 million rides and in July 2020 the system reached 100 million rides. As of July 2019, there are 169,000 annual subscribers. Monthly average ridership numbers increased above 100,000 for the first time in June 2021. The all-time record for single-day ridership occurred on September 11, 2021, when the system had 135,005 rides.

In this challenge, a data story is created for two unexpected phenomena with data collected from the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage is visualised in form of a dashboard to answer the following questions:

* A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
* Most popular bike types used in 2021 compared to 2022
* Most popular Start Stations comparison by bike type and membership status
* Most popular start and end station comparion for 2021 and 2022
* Least popular start and end station comparision for 2021 and 2022
